## About me

I'm a tenacious problem solver with a tech-oriented approach, and have recently decided to re-enter the workforce after taking some time off. Since I first laid eyes on a spreadsheet in 1997, I have been in love and I want to follow my passion by transitioning into a career as a data analyst to tell the stories data holds.

What sets me apart is my analytical thinking, attention to detail, self-motivation, and my drive for process optimization and efficiency. I am committed to making impactful improvements within companies, from cleaner data for better reporting to streamlined business processes and enhanced customer communications.

## Professional Experience

### Business Operations Manager, 2013 to 2019

Since 2015, all work was performed remotely and the timelines of the various projects overlap so for brevity, I list a few highlights from this period.

#### Bigspool Inc., USA

This started as a small project on Upwork and very quickly developed into a full-time role with my "if I don't know, I will find out'-attitude. My role grew exponentially and responsibilities along with it. The CEO Hao Jiang wrote this [recommendation](/Other/Bigspool-Recommendation.pdf) for my time with Bigspool.

- **Oversee** 7 marketplaces and 5 consumer brands attending to customer support and bi-weekly inventory fulfillment and restocking orders for over 30,000 units and $250,000
_ **Reduce operational costs** by creating integrated forecasting reports from an inventory database I built enabling effective inventory management and cutting down costs of monthly paid subscription services
- **Product development** coordinated for over 50 product line launches and helped bring over 50,000 new product SKUs to market
- **Business continuity** improved by creating a centralized knowledge centre in Notion across multiple business divisions

#### Tilburg University, Netherlands

This was a large financial project to capture historical stock ledgers and particularly tickled the puzzle-solving part of my brain. I am extremely proud of what I have accomplished here and, with permission, can showcase a [summary of my work](/Other/Project-Tilburg-University.pdf). The main highlights:

- **Capture, prepare and clean data** in order to digitize historical stock ledgers and to create a standardized database with unique trader and transaction identifiers
- **Research and solve problems** such as currency conversion, accounting for the change from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, consolidating duplicate accounts, interpreting weathered and damaged pages written in ink.

#### College of Animal Chiropractors & Veterinary Chiropractic Learning Centre, Canada & USA

- **Technical, administrative and customer support** to introduce Google Suite for membership management, updating learning material and website information, recording new members and membership fees
- **Maintain database** ensuring members records are consistent and up to date

#### ENSafrica, South Africa

- **Enhanced security and streamlined reporting** by creating a centralized access-card database from scratch, resolving inefficiencies in tracking and improving coordination across multiple locations
- **Leveraged automation to reduce manual effort** of a labour and time intensive administrative task assigning expenses by preparing the data to apply effective filtering
- **Technical and administrative support** to personnel to maintain efficiency and ensuring compliance with company policies
- **Maintain database** ensuring personnel records are consistent and up to date

### Legal Assistant, 2001 to 2013

- **Secure $1 million business contract** by designing an innovative due diligence report, transforming the company's standard template with a custom-branded theme, curated artwork, and a visually striking layout for a globally operating company
- **Maintain confidentiality** in handling sensitive information when preparing legal documents
- **Ensure document governance** by keeping record of changes to ensure transparency and successful collaboration between contributors
- **Act as a liaison** between legal professionals and clients with effective, professional communication and clear, concise writing skills
- **Effective time-management** in managing schedules and prioritizing tasks to maintain efficient operations and facilitate smooth workflows
